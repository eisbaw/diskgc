# diskgc testing

Normative for how the PRD's acceptance criteria and the guarantees in
[safety.md](safety.md) are tested.

**No test ever runs diskgc against the developer's live system.** Tests run
against a modelled host (in-process) or inside a rootless test container.

## 1. Planner tests: plain data

The planner is a pure function (index in; plan, skip reasons, exit-code
precedence and report out), so eligibility, ordering, skip reasons, the
exit-code table, the dry-run plan and the JSON report are tested as data,
with no host at all.

## 2. Model tests: a YAML host model instead of a real disk

All of diskgc's access to the machine goes through the `Host` port
([architecture.md](architecture.md#the-host-port)), so tests substitute
`ModelHost`, which answers from a *host model*. Nothing is intercepted at
the kernel level: no FUSE, no `LD_PRELOAD`.

The model is data, not a second Linux:

- **Inode graph**, not a path map: hard links, renames and "an entry
  replaced between the identity check and the unlink" are expressible.
- **Derived, not duplicated**: available space is computed (filesystem size
  − allocated blocks, each inode counted once − `other_used`), so deleting
  something in the model frees space in the model.
- **Grown on demand**: mounts (ids, parents, types including nfs/btrfs,
  bind and stacked mounts), trees with owners, locks (holders and waiters),
  processes (exe, cwd, root, initial environ, uid, open fds including
  deleted files, memory mappings), kernel capabilities (`statx` masks,
  `openat2`), scripted `docker` / `nix-store`, clock, delayed freeing.
- **Strict loading**: unknown keys are errors, references must resolve, and
  a JSON Schema is generated for editors.
- **Events on the call trace.** A race is an event between two `Host` calls,
  addressed by the call (`at: {op: unlinkat, path: <…>, nth: 1, when:
  before}`), not by a hook in the product. Property tests place an event
  after every call *k* in turn, covering every interleaving of a small
  scenario.

```yaml
host_model: 1
clock: 2026-10-15T03:00:00Z
mounts:
  - {id: 1, at: /,     fs: ext4, dev: "254:1", size: 1000G, other_used: 980G}
  - {id: 2, at: /home, fs: ext4, dev: "254:2", size: 900G,  other_used: 880G, parent: 1}
tree:
  /home/mark/src/app/target:
    CACHEDIR.TAG: {cachedir_tag: true}
    debug:
      .cargo-lock: {}
      deps: {size: 8G, mtime: 2026-10-01T00:00:00Z}
locks:
  - {path: /home/mark/src/app/target/debug/.cargo-lock, holder: 4242, mode: exclusive}
processes:
  - {pid: 4242, exe: /nix/store/x-cargo/bin/cargo, cwd: /home/mark/src/app}
events:
  - at: {op: flock, path: /home/mark/src/app/target/debug/.cargo-lock, nth: 1, when: after}
    create: /home/mark/src/app/target/release/.cargo-lock
expect:
  exit: 1
  skipped: [{candidate: /home/mark/src/app/target, reason: locked}]
```

Fixtures live in `tests/models/<area>/<case>.yaml`, one named test per file;
JSON reports are snapshot-tested with durations, timestamps and seed
redacted.

Model scenarios required by [safety.md](safety.md) and
[architecture.md](architecture.md), among others:

- an entry renamed out of a candidate, or replaced by another inode,
  between the walk and its unlink: the replacement is never deleted, the
  candidate is `changed`;
- a candidate directory renamed elsewhere mid-delete: deletion continues on
  the checked object only;
- a user-owned directory containing another user's file: `not_owner`;
- a bucket whose later member is opened by a process after an earlier
  member was deleted: the later member is skipped (`in_use`);
- a stale index (deep modification, a new `.diskgc-keep`, a new Cargo
  target inside a `tmp-entry` candidate, a new protected match after the
  tally): the deletion-time checks refuse what they must;
- new candidates of a stale tier created after the snapshot: they are
  deleted before any pressure tier runs (per-tier discovery);
- a `TMPDIR` changed by `export` after `exec`: documented as invisible (the
  test pins the heuristic's known limit);
- deadline overruns: a blocking operation that exceeds the deadline is
  reported as an overrun, and no new work starts after it;
- command actions under `--allow-root`: refused at load.

## 3. Property tests

`diskgc-modelgen` generates random host models (`proptest`) and checks:

- no Cargo lock file ever deleted or moved; nothing deleted that the walk
  did not check; no symlink followed; no mount crossed (on the call trace);
- every deleted entry's owner was authorised;
- **the index is never an authority:** with a randomly stale, partial or
  corrupted index, every deletion still passes the deletion-time checks,
  and nothing is deleted that a run with a correct index would refuse;
- the exit code follows the full precedence table for the final state;
- **selection semantics:** the eligible candidates equal a simple reference
  implementation of the rules in [reference.md](reference.md#selection-grammar);
  `!` and `protect` never add a candidate; `a || b` equals `b || a`; every
  eligible candidate was found by some source profile;
- **dry-run agreement**, narrowed to what is true: for non-overlapping
  candidates, `ordered` groups, `oldest` order and the same index (or
  `--no-index --tally-budget 0`), the real run's actions are a prefix of the
  eligible plan entries. With overlapping candidates or `best-fit`, every
  difference between plan and run is explained by a recorded reason (a
  child `missing` because its parent was deleted, a `best-fit` re-pick
  after observed space).

A failing case shrinks to a minimal model, printed as YAML; developers save
it under `crates/diskgc-model/tests/regressions/`, where it is replayed.
Regression files pin the host-model schema and are migrated when it
changes.

**Profile golden sets.** Each built-in profile has a fixture tree and a
golden set of what it matches there. Any change to that set fails CI unless
the profile was renamed ([reference.md](reference.md#built-in-profile-library)).
This also covers the profile's uses under `!profile:` and `protect`,
since those use the same matching.

## 4. Differential contract tests

`materialize(model)` builds a host model for real on a scratch tmpfs inside
a test container (directories, `fallocate`d files, owners via subuid ranges,
bind and stacked mounts, symlinks, helper processes holding locks or
files), and the same scenarios run on `ModelHost` and on `LinuxHost`;
traces and outcomes must match. Model fields that cannot be built for real
in a rootless container (clock, kernel capabilities, exact `statvfs`
numbers, filesystem types other than tmpfs, NFS, scripted Docker/Nix,
delayed freeing) are marked *model-only*; tests that use them say so.

## 5. End-to-end tests in containers

The real binary in **rootless Podman containers**, built from images Nix
produces. They run everywhere, need no KVM, and isolate the test's
filesystem, processes and mounts from the developer's system.

- **Cargo race tests**, each with real Cargo processes, against every
  supported Cargo version (at least the oldest supported stable and one
  dated nightly), on fixture projects with no registry dependencies,
  offline. Races are made deterministic (a helper holding `.cargo-lock`
  makes Cargo take `.cargo-build-lock` and block; a `build.rs` waits on a
  control file; a `runner` wrapper pauses between compile and run):
  1. a build holding the lock: its target is skipped;
  2. a build that starts during deletion waits, then succeeds;
  3. one build blocked on the lock plus another started right after the
     reclaim never run concurrently, and both succeed;
  4. a target whose test binary is still running is skipped;
  5. a new profile (`--release`, `--target`) started between discovery and
     locking: skipped as `changed`, its build succeeds;
  6. diskgc SIGKILLed during deletion at each point of a seeded list of
     positions in its call trace: the next `cargo build` always succeeds;
  7. a `cargo check` paused after taking `.cargo-build-lock` and before
     `.cargo-lock`, plus a concurrent `cargo build`: the target is skipped,
     no lock file is ever unlinked, both commands succeed;
  8. `cargo run` / `cargo test` on an old, up-to-date target, paused
     between compilation and execution: skipped as `in_use`, the binary
     runs;
  9. a profile directory with an unknown `.cargo-*lock*` file: skipped as
     `unsupported_layout`.
- **Mounts** a rootless container can create: tmpfs, bind mounts (including
  a bind mount of the same filesystem), stacked mounts; the path-traversal
  rules.
- **Filesystem profiles** on the scratch tmpfs mounted at the container's
  `/tmp`: entries held open, used as working directory, mapped, named in a
  process's initial environment, `flock`ed, containing a socket or FIFO,
  containing a mount, a mixed-owner tree (subuid ranges), a file created
  mid-delete, a deleted-but-open file in `held_by_deleted_files`, and a root
  with 100,000+ entries (ordering cost, aggregated reports, time to first
  deletion including the eligibility walk).
- **Dormant shells:** real `nix-shell` and `nix develop` sessions left idle
  with their `TMPDIR` under `/tmp`: their directories are skipped.
- **Docker** in its own container (`docker:dind` under rootless Podman,
  verified to work on the development machine), images preloaded offline;
  backend binding: a non-default builder or a remote context is skipped
  with its reason.
- **Nix GC** in a container with its own store and daemon.
- **Signals, deadlines, the CI-hook use of `ensure`, `watch` as a plain
  process.**
- **Not only Nix:** the same tests in a container from a common non-Nix
  distribution image (e.g. Debian) with the static binary, without Nix, and
  a variant without Docker.
- **Shipped files:** the systemd unit is checked with `systemd-analyze
  verify` (in `just check`); the tmpfiles drop-in is applied with
  `systemd-tmpfiles --root=<scratch> --create` in the container harness
  and the resulting lock file checked. The NixOS module is checked by
  evaluation in `nix flake check`.

**Not covered end-to-end (for now):** real block filesystems (ext4 or xfs
as separate mounts, btrfs) and network filesystems cannot be mounted in a
rootless container; behaviour on specific kernel versions follows the test
host's kernel; systemd is not run for real. These rest on model tests with
model-only fields. A VM suite can be added later.

Why not FUSE: it has its own `flock`, `statx` and mount-id semantics, needs
privileges, and is a large extra moving part.

Container tests cannot run inside the Nix build sandbox, so they run from
`just e2e`, not as `nix flake check` checks.

## Safety interlock for destructive tests

An environment variable is not enough (it leaks through `export`, direnv,
CI settings). Three layers:

1. **Build-time:** destructive tests live in `diskgc-e2e`, excluded from the
   workspace; no `cargo` command in the workspace compiles it. It is built
   only into the test image.
2. **Run-time:** the test binary refuses to run unless a marker file baked
   into the test image exists (`/.diskgc-test-sandbox`, holding a constant
   also compiled into the binary) and Podman's container marker
   (`/run/.containerenv`) exists. (A kernel command-line token would not
   work: a container sees the host's `/proc/cmdline`.)
3. **Per operation:** every test asserts that the paths it touches are on
   the scratch tmpfs the harness mounted for it (checked by mount id), and
   aborts otherwise.

## Commands

| `just` recipe | What | When |
|---|---|---|
| `check` | fmt, clippy, unit, planner, model tests, property tests (few cases), profile golden sets, `systemd-analyze verify` of the shipped unit, in the dev shell | constantly; seconds |
| `e2e` | `check` plus all container tests (images built with Nix, run with Podman) | before every commit (the gate); budget under 5 minutes, split the suite if it grows past that |
| `e2e-one NAME` | one container test, keeping the container on failure | while working on one |
| `soak` | property tests with many cases | before a release, nightly CI |
| `ci` | `nix flake check -L` plus `just e2e` | CI |

Requirements for `just e2e`: Nix and rootless Podman (CI runners that are
themselves containers need nested Podman). Coverage of unit and model tests
via `cargo llvm-cov`.
